# gnn_assignment

## Getting started

- Unzip the data from `data.zip` to get started.

## Outline of the assignment

### Part 1: Graph exploration
- The notebook notebooks/GraphExploration.ipynb contains the code for the first part of this assignment. The goal of this part is to introduce you to `graph.py`, the class that represents a graph and some of its methods.


### Part 2: Implementing a GCN

This has two sub-parts:
1. Implementing a GCN layer
2. Using the GCN layer to implement a GCN model

### Part 3: Node classification


## Dataset
- The dataset is located in `data.zip`.

## 

## Running node classification
```sh
bash scripts/run_node_classification.sh [GRAPH_NAME]
```
E.g.,  
```sh
bash scripts/run_node_classification.sh citeseer_plus_topo
```

- The usage for graph classification and link prediction is similar.
